# Working with Emulated Data

We know not everyone has a device laying around the house they can connect to an IoT Hub, so we've provided you with some emulated device data that will allow you to see the system in action before connecting your first device.

## Enable Emulated Data

To start the emulated data flowing to your dashboard, simply enable the slide toggle.

Once enabled, if no devices have been added yet, the telemtry sync will automatically enable and you'll begin to see the emulated device telemetry in the table on the dashboard.

:::note

While emulated data is enabled, the emulated data will be mixed with any real device data you have streaming into the system.  Not just in the dashboard, but also in your API calls.

:::

## Disable Emulated Data

If you would like to remove the emulated data from your dashboard and APIs, simply disable the emulated data.
