# Buy and Scale Devices

From our own experience and that of our customers, we know that starting new IoT projects at a cost effective pace is important to success.  Unfortunately, all to often teams usually run into longer than estimated timelines and unknown cost spikes as they begin their cloud-native IoT journey.  Fathym's IoT Ensemble delivers an IoT project starting point that works for novices through senior architects, to deliver a repeatable, scalable enterprise IoT solution.  [Get started](https://www.iot-ensemble.com/billing/iot) now, no credit card required.

## Choosing a Plan

Choosing a plan will have a lot to do with decisions around private vs shared cloud, and the velocity at which data needs to move through the IoT system.  Here are some high level descriptions of our plans to help you try and determine the right place to start, or read the [complete licenses guide](../developers/licenses) for more in depth information.

### Shared Plans

Our shared plans are geared at offering a more structured understanding of cost and data velocity.  Great for teams new to IoT or lacking cloud-native experience, one of our shared plans will offer a cost per device understanding as the IoT solution scales.  If our shared plans don't fit the IoT project needs, look at how the enterprise plans can help you.  

### Enterprise Plans

Need more data velocity?  Looking to host on a private cloud?  Bring the same great solutions and simplicty (with additional tools and horsepower) to deliver IoT solutions at scale in private enterprise clouds.

Enterprise plans are available, though not yet entirely self-service.  To get started, choose an [enterprise license](https://www.fathym-it.com/billing/lcu) then use our docs, blogs, and customer support to get the IoT Ensemble deployed in a private cloud.

## Adding More Devices

With an additional license (shared or enterprise), all of the tools we have reviewed so far (and the ones we'll look deeper at now) are ready to use for multiple devices.  Enroll additional devices to get more data flowing and continue reading through the documentation to learn how to leverage additional security practices, APIs, and functionality.
