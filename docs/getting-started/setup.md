# Setting Up Your IoT Ensemble

Fathym IoT Ensemble enables developers to rapidly connect devices using best practice workflows for cloud-native IoT applications.

In the getting started guide, in only a few clicks, we'll walk you through connecting your first device.  You'll be able to choose between connecting with your own devices, emulated device data, or existing device feeds.  Once setup, we'll show you how you can deploy and manage visualizations across a variety of technologies (JS, PowerBI, Jupiter Notebooks).  Finally we'll walk you through how you can deliver these visualizations to your customers in a secure way.  

To kick things off, you can visit our [IoT Ensemble](https://www.iot-ensemble.com/dashboard) sign up page (no credit card required).
