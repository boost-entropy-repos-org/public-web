# Setting Up Your IoT Ensemble

Fathym IoT Ensemble enables developers to rapidly build modular and reusable IoT applications by automating best practice workflows for cloud-native application orchestration.

In the getting started guide, in only a few clicks, we'll walk you through connecting your first device.  You'll be able to choose between connecting with your own devices or emulated device data<!--, or existing device feeds-->.  Once setup, we'll show you how you can deploy and manage visualizations across a variety of technologies (JS, PowerBI, Jupiter Notebooks).  Finally we'll walk you through how you can deliver these visualizations to your customers in a secure way.  

To kick things off, you can visit our [IoT Ensemble](https://www.fathym-it.com/iot) sign up page.
