# Setting Up Your IoT Ensemble

Fathym IoT Ensemble enables developers to rapidly connect devices using best practice workflows for cloud-native IoT applications.

In the getting started guide, in only a few clicks, we'll walk you through connecting your first device.  You'll be able to work with your own devices or emulated device data.  Once setup, we'll show you how you can access your device data and connect it with downstream technologies (JS, PowerBI, Jupiter Notebooks).  Finally we'll walk you through how you can deliver these visualizations to your customers in a secure way.  

To kick things off, you can visit the [IoT Ensemble](https://www.iot-ensemble.com/dashboard) sign up page (no credit card required) and access your dashboard.

## IoT Ensemble Dashboard

Once signed in, you'll land in the IoT Ensemble Dashboard with a Free License.  A one stop, cloud-native IoT starting point, the dashboard is your control system for data emulation, connecting devices, understanding data and connecting with downstream services.
