# Welcome to Fathym IoT Ensemble

A platform focused on helping you connect your devices, understand your data and scale your IoT applications.

Managing the learning path, usage and growth of cloud-native IoT development strategies can be a daunting challenge. With IoT Ensemble you can reliably deliver IoT applications across hybrid-clouds.

## Connect, Understand, Scale

Typically when starting with a new cloud-native IoT solution, your not only wokring towards connecting your device, but also on how to process and store its data in order to do tasks like visualization, machine learning, and application development.  This requires learning a number of cloud-native technologies before being able to deliver your solution.

IoT Ensemble operates as a virtual development team that automates best practices for IoT application delivery.  In order to help you focus on building applications and creating value, we built the platform to augment your teamâ€™s skills and do your heavy lifting.

The platform radically reduces the time and work involved in getting your devices connected, understanding your data, and bringing end-to-end customer driven IoT applications to bear.
