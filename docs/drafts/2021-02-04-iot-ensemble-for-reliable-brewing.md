## The Challenge

Brewing is a complicated process that requires a high level of precision to deliver a consistent product. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can help breweries implement more streamlined and reliable methods of utilizing the data generated by their machinery, as well as supplementing that data with additional sensors to monitor equipment and brewing conditions.

Much of the brewing process takes place in large tanks that are carefully heated by a boiler or furnace and maintained at a set temperature. However, if a boiler or furnace goes out for a period of time, this can lead to loss of product that results in financial losses.

Breweries that have experienced these difficulties are looking for a solution that can accurately monitor their equipment. Once accurate data readings are captured via sensors are set up and flowing, breweries can quickly see the real value of this data for optimizing the brewing process. The value of IoT data is especially apparent when breweries are alerted to emergencies in real time, allowing them to prevent disasters that could damage or even destroy their yield.

## The Solution

Many IoT projects start with trying to get device data flowing to the cloud, but this is often the trickiest stage of an IoT implementation. Using IoT Ensemble, breweries can start a project with emulated data and easily see it flowing to 3rd party dashboards and alerts.

For a brewery, this means they can verify that an end-to-end IoT infrastructure is working as expected and data is flowing to the correct outputs before the challenge of connecting real devices is tackled. This also allows brewers to ascertain the device data they need to optimize their brewing operations and ensure ROI before spending money on sensor deployment.

Once a brewery has identified the type of data they want to collect, hardware can be deployed. For breweries we’ve worked with, this has involved an infrared USB (IRUSB) temperature sensor to monitor furnace and glycol temperature. The sensors are connected to a Raspberry Pi that operates as a gateway and streams the sensor data into IoT Ensemble. From there, you can easily access the data for use in dashboards and alerts.

Breweries can configure custom alerts, so brewery staff can be notified when temperatures or liquid levels drop too low or get too high. Build customizable, mobile-friendly, real-time data dashboards to check on temperatures and levels remotely.

## The Results

In one instance, a Denver craft brewer we work with reported that their boiler went out during the weekend when no staff were on site. Fathym’s solution alerted them to the situation so they could react immediately. This saved what ultimately could have cost the brewery thousands of dollars in time and lost product.

> "You saved us a whole day of brewing! If we didn’t have the alert and we didn’t come in to check Sunday or Monday, we would have walked in to cold water today. And it takes so long to heat up that we wouldn’t have been able to brew at all today, which messes up the whole week!"
> Director of Operations at Crazy Mountain Brewery, Denver, Colorado

After seeing the initial success of deploying sensors, breweries are identifying what other data may help them monitor their operations efficiently. This includes installing temperature and depth sensors on all beer and grain tanks while also deploying additional sensors to monitor the fermentation process and more.
