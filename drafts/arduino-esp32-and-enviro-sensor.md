## Connecting Sparkfun ESP32 Board and CCS811/BME200 Environmental Sensor with IoT Ensemble

In this tutorial, we will be taking a generic ESP32 board, connecting a simple environment sensor, and send messages with IoT Ensemble. For simplicity sake, I have chosen to use Sparkfun's "Qwiic" connect ecosystem, which is a plug-and-play method of connecting boards and sensors. 

### Things you will need
- [SparkFun Thing Plus - ESP32 WROOM Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663) (You may also use a different generic ESP32 board, but it won't use the Qwiic system)
- [Qwiic Cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14426) (Any length is fine for this tutorial)
- Your computer/laptop
- A Micro-USB cable to connect the ESP32 to your computer
- [SparkFun Environmental Combo Breakout - CCS811/BME280](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14348) (Again, you may choose to use a more generic version of this sensor, but it won't use the Qwiic system)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your computer
- A [Fathym IoT Ensemble](https://www.iot-ensemble.com/dashboard) account (weâ€™re using the free, shared version)
